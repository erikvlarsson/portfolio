          Delightful product design is like light traveling through a prism. The
          catalyst; raw project requirements. I filter them through my creative
          process, twisting… as ideas take shape. Turning… as core design
          principles intersect with today’s best practices. The result?
          High-fidelity UI design that performs from every angle. Take a look.
