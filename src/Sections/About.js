          My job is to understand what the user wants, and have an intelligently
          coded interface to provide exactly that. As is the case with any ‘user
          experience,’ it’s all about enhancing the satisfaction of the
          consumer. To boil it down to one simple sentence, it’s about keeping
          the user interested, while providing what ever function your site
          advertises.
